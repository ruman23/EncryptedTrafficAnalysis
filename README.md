# Characterizing Encrypted Application Traffic through Cellular Radio Interface Protocol

## Project Overview

This repository contains scripts and a limited dataset used for the paper titled **"Characterizing Encrypted Application Traffic through Cellular Radio Interface Protocol"**. The full dataset will be uploaded after the paper is published in a journal.

## Folder Structure

- **Data/**: This folder contains the extracted RRB dataset.
- **RandomForestClassifier.py**: This script performs classification using the Random Forest algorithm.
- **ExtraTreesClassifier.py**: This script performs classification using the Extra Trees algorithm.
- **ExtractFeaturesForMLModels.py**: This script processes the extracted RRB datasets and calculates the statistical features for machine learning models.
- **data.csv**: This is the output file generated by `ExtractFeaturesForMLModels.py`, containing the processed data with extracted features.



## File Descriptions

### 1. ExtractFeaturesForMLModels.py

**Purpose**: This script processes the raw datasets and extracts statistical features such as mean, max, standard deviation, slope, and quartiles for both `UL` and `DL`. The extracted features are saved in `data.csv`.

**How to Run**:
```sh
python ExtractFeaturesForMLModels.py
```

# Machine Learning Classification Scripts

This repository contains scripts for classification using the Random Forest and Extra Trees algorithms. The scripts use extracted features from `data.csv` to perform the classification and evaluate the classifier's performance.

## Scripts

1. **RandomForestClassifier.py**
   - **Purpose:** This script performs classification using the Random Forest algorithm. It evaluates the classifier's performance and prints the accuracy and classification report.
   - **How to Run:**
     ```sh
     python RandomForestClassifier.py
     ```

2. **ExtraTreesClassifier.py**
   - **Purpose:** This script performs classification using the Extra Trees algorithm. It also does a similar analysis of RandomForestClassifier.
   - **How to Run:**
      ```sh
     python ExtraTreesClassifier.py
      ```

## Required Libraries

To run these scripts, you need to install the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip: 
 ```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn scipy matplotlib
```
